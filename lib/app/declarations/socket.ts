Let us create a base class for socket events and messages, with this base class we want to create a separation between
the socket server, the logic handler on the server, the data on the message, and the actual message itself.

So let us discuss how exactly we are going to layout the structure of the application. Considering the configurable
items, that is, the message name and the default responses.

    Let us make some more consideration with this class.

    We need to create a good bridge between sockets that includes the considerations that we have made in the above
    discussion. so what we are saying is that we need to establish the connection from the client in a way that the
    server listens for events according to the number of users that are connected.

    So for this to work I believe we need to work in an initializer function that will setup connections dynamically
    as the user connects. This should work like a key lock system for us so that the user connects to the server
    efficiently through some other channel.

    To add more clarity we need to make sure we need to understand what it is that we are doing. So let us start by
    considering the initializer function. since from this class we expect that the socket server is accessible and that
    the HTTP server is up and running we need to have a base set of functions and events that will listen for connection
    establishments. now when the connection is established the socket handler will need to run through a set of
    functionalities for the client connection so that the server starts listening for certain messages along a certain
    chain name on the message object.

    So now, if a user connects, the socket on connect event should fire to configure all the callbacks for that
    connection. this way we can have a dynamic set of message events that work with the application.

    Another consideration to make is that when a user connects that connection is represented by as socket, so then
    if we bind or bootstrap the socket with the services needed then we should be able to add any functionality that is

    so now with the socket object in place we should be able to do a lot more.
