/*
services here are considered to be a complete set of characteristics that we can define in order to influence
the structure of the interface below. considering the characteristics of services we can build a small set that
can later be increased in number:

i.  a service from the reading ive done considers a domain of capability.
ii. a service also considers itself to be completely independent from other services
iii.a service has a form or style in which it communicates with other services
iv. a service does not require sharing resources with other services
v.  a service can have prefixing validation calls as well as post fixed calls. (hooks)
vi. a service in this context is a black box.

Allowing the analysis and digestion of these considerations we can then derive properties that we can add in
our interface. From this we see that our service is definitely in support of a model to abstract data, functionality
and realism. The interface will also have to have hooks in order to validate data or similar.

Worth noting though is that the hooks, or moreover the service should be completely independent of other external
entities with the exception of the context that will be needed from the application instance on express. With that
said the hooks should not be confined to a specific external input but should be confined to the internal
structure of the system as if it to say we are manipulating an instance of the service itself.

Services should be able to communicate information with other services with no need for mediation or proxies,
that is, services require a way of interfacing itself by exposing certain functions that give out information.
Additionally, services of the application should be the only way in which external entities interact with the
service. This way we ensure that the service remains a 'black box'.

A constraint we have considered adding to the service interface is to bind it and make it dependent on the
mongoose extension to express.

Hooks is concept much like middleware in this application, yet there can be some separation made between the
two in terms of the microservice concepts we are attempting in this frame. Hooks in other known cases are used
to manipulate and alter the data of the service model or use it to make some computational descision.

Now whats missing is a way to bind service functions or functions extended from services directly to service
service configurations.
